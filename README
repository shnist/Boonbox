Best Practices for BoonBox Front-End Development

Please follow these guidelines when developing the site. Because you know.. they're awesome. 

/* HTML */ 

// HTML5

: We will be developing in HTML5 so please use the HTML5 doctype
: HTML5 elements do not need to be self-closed (e.g. write <img> instead of <img/>

// Keeping things minimal

: Do not use a div to for clearing - it bloats the mark up -  and it's not necessary
: Do not use br elements for positioning. this is what css is for. 

// Element names

: Please no acronyms for id and class names - makes the code less readable
: Please use dashes for id and class names (e.g. main-navigation) - if both of you prefer to use
  camel casing then that's cool - just as long as it's consistent :)

// Performance

: Put javascript files as close to the bottom of the document as possible (just above the closing body tag)


/* CSS */

: Avoid using margin-left, margin-top, etc. where possible - this makes it difficult to track 
  bugs later on 
: !importants are the spawn of the devil - they break the cascading nature of the stylesheet and
  lead to all sorts of problems - please avoid at all costs
