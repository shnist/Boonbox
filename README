Best Practices for BoonBox 

/* Templates */
: Inside htmlTemplates/templates you'll find an HTML template file, please copy and paste this file
  whenever you want to make a new page
: Add new pages to the htmlTemplates/pages folder
: Sections that occur throughout the site, e.g. footer, header, head, scripts and filters - have been put
  into separate blocks that can be found in htmlTemplates/blocks - please work in those files
  when updating those sections. 


/* Naming */

// Ids and Class names
: Please no acronyms for id and class names - makes the code less readable
: Please use dashes for id and class names (e.g. main-navigation) - if both of you prefer to use
  camel casing then that's cool - just as long as it's consistent

// File names
: Please use _ for file names (e.g. boonbox_logo.jpg) 


/* CSS */

: please read reserved class name section of common.css
: !importants are the spawn of the devil - they break the cascading nature of the stylesheet and
  lead to all sorts of problems - please avoid
